# books i have read
Decided to start tracking the books I've read since 2019.

# Special Note for 2021:
My older brother passed away at the end of November, 2020. As kids born in the early 70s we literally grew up with Star Wars. And so to honour him and the bond we shared with Star Wars, when 2021 rolled around I made a promise to myself that I would only read Star Wars books for the entire year. This is a way for me to keep track of that promise. 

# 2022
Man! I almost hit last year's total!!!! So close. =(
